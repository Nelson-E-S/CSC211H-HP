## Inspiration
With COVID-19 and Social Justice at the forefront of news in the year of 2020 I wanted to share some facts about topics that lie in both subjects. Using a game modeled after Jeopardy I present several pieces of trivia for the users.
## What it does
The app loads several trivia questions that hit broad range topics within the subjects of Social Injustice and COVID-19. The users picks from three given choice and gets awarded points based on correct answers chosen. The users score can be saved for future improvement.

## Challenges
* Learning a whole new syntax suite with QT
* Ensuring the accuracy of the questions loaded and presented
* Ensuring the accuracy of the highscores loaded, presented, and saved
